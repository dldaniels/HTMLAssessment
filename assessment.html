       <strong>Mutant</strong> Football League is a game that I first started playing back when I was wee little 10 year old in like 1993 or something on the Sega Genesis. It was one of my favorite game ever. The basic idea behind it is that it is football played by teams consisting of Monster Orcs, Skeletons, Aliens, Robots, Ogres,and Super Human Mutants. The teams and players all had funny names. The fields are all set with traps and players actually can be killed while playing in comical ways.

         <em><strong>Every</strong> team has a variety of dirty tricks in their playbook where they can gain an advantage over the other team. Every team has the ability to bribe the ref once per half and when the ref is bought he will begin to call ridiculous penalties on the other team for picking their nose or things like that. Of course if this happens to your team you have the option to just kill that ref and a new one is appointed to the game. It is as much a battle game as it is a football game. It brings a new element to the game of football where you have to have a strategy that promotes cheating and chaos.

      <strong>Mutant</strong> football league lives on again when sometime in 2016 or so the originaly developer of the game began a kickstarter campaign to bring the game to newer consoles and give it an update. The new game now features all the same chaos, fun, and humor of the Sega version but with many more added features and awesomness. All of the teams are now actual parodies of real NFL teams and the players are all parodies of real NFL players. I sometimes play it with my 12 year old but I have now reached that point in my life where my children think the stuff I like is bogus and lame. I have pretty much lost that boy to Fortnite. Here you can see actual exciting footage of myself playing Mutant League Football and munching on cheetos and Crystal Pepsi in 1993. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ"target=_blank>Enjoy</a>
